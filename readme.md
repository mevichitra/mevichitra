## 🎯 **What I'm cooking up**

Currently neck-deep in **[OpenIntervue](https://openintervue.com)** — because apparently the world needed another way to make tech interviews less painful. Who knew?

When I'm not wrestling with distributed systems or explaining why we can't just "*make it faster*," I'm usually:

```yaml
daily_chaos:
  - Writing code that future-me will definitely curse at
  - Turning random 3 AM ideas into actual products 
  - Pretending I understand business while secretly just wanting to build cool tech
```

## 💫 **What I'm actually good at**

<div align="center">

| 🎯 **Core Skills** | 🚀 **Specialty** |
|:---:|:---:|
| Making things work at scale | Leading teams without losing my sanity |
| *(usually without breaking too much stuff)* | *(jury's still out on this one)* |
| **Turning "it works on my machine"** | **Product strategy that doesn't involve** |
| **into "it works everywhere"** | **just adding more features** |

## 🏏 **Plot twist**

<div align="center">

```
🏏 Weekends = Pretending I'm the next MS Dhoni
🎤      OR   = Auditioning for Indian Idol in my shower

Both careers are going equally well.
```
