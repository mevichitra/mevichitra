# Hi, I'm Vichitra 👋🏻
Cofounder & CTO @ [OpenIntervue](https://openintervue.com)  
Building stuff that probably shouldn't work but somehow does.

### 🚀 What I'm cooking up
Currently neck-deep in [OpenIntervue](https://openintervue.com) — because apparently the world needed another way to make tech interviews less painful. Who knew?

When I'm not wrestling with distributed systems or explaining why we can't just "make it faster," I'm usually:
- Writing code that future-me will definitely curse at
- Turning random 3 AM ideas into actual products (with varying degrees of success)
- Pretending I understand business while secretly just wanting to build cool tech

### 🤝 Let's vibe
- Slide into my DMs: [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/vichitrue)
- Carrier pigeons also accepted (but delivery not guaranteed)

### 🎯 What I'm actually good at
- Making things work at scale (usually without breaking too much stuff)
- Leading teams without losing my sanity (jury's still out on this one)
- Turning "it works on my machine" into "it works everywhere"
- Product strategy that doesn't involve just adding more features

### 🏏 Plot twist
Weekends find me either pretending I'm the next MS Dhoni or auditioning for Indian Idol in my shower. Both careers are going equally well.

*P.S. If you're still doing tech interviews on Google Docs, we need to talk.*
